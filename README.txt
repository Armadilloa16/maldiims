Files in ./analysisFunctions, ./dataManagement, and ./plottingFunctions
are all authored by me, and contain MATLAB functions I use in the 
process of doing work towards my PhD on the analysis of MALDI Imaging 
data.

./codeSM contains some code written by Steve Marron & co. 
(http://www.unc.edu/~marron/marron.html), which I have used. 

./otherPeoplesCode contains some code written by various other people I 
have used as well.

./projectDrivers contains the driver scripts for running the analyses 
in my thesis.
